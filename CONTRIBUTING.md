# Contributing to the Sac DESCO website

Sac DESCO is an interdisciplinary creative community in Sacramento, CA. Presumably, you're here to help improve our website, so thank you!

These are the guidelines for contributing to this project. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of those managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## What we're looking for

If you find something that could use a little help, whether it's a bug, or adding something new and awesome, we'd be happy to work with you to include it on our website.

## Ground Rules

* Make sure your changes are a11y-friendly. We recommend using the [axe browser extension](https://www.deque.com/axe/axe-for-web/) to check for high-level compliance.
* Test your changes on at least Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on desktop and try at least one of the browsers on Android or iOS/iPadOS
* Be sure to adhere to established code styles.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Your First Contribution

If you're new to open source, don't worry. We've all been there! Here are some things that will help guide you through your first pull request:

* A free, 38 min course on [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
* A [straightforward tutorial](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/github-desktop-tutorial.md) on the steps to contribute using GitHub Desktop

## Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Make the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the project's code style
    * Send a pull request

## How to report a bug

### Security Issues

If you find a security issue, do NOT open an issue. Email thisisdesco@gmail.com instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at thisisdesco@gmail.com.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What browser are you using?
2. What operating system are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find something that you think will help improve the experience for users of the Sac DESCO website, feel free to add an issue to start a discussion. This is always a good place to start, even if you don't plan to submit your own pull request to add your suggested enhancement.

## Code review process

After a pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by one of our maintainers. You should hear back from them in a reasonable amount of time with any changes they might deem appropriate.

## Community

If you'd like to get in touch with the Sac DESCO organizers or just want to get involved in our community, please [join our Slack channel](https://sac-desco.slack.com/)!
