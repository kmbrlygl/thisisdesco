## OUR MISSION
Sac Desco (Design Collective)'s goal is to provide a community in Sacramento for individuals from all backgrounds, fields and skill levels who are interested in design and design thinking.

Our members come from diverse backgrounds such as: Biology, History, Software Engineering, Design, Cognitive Science, and Human Development.

Our interests include: UX, UI, illustration, web design, photography, typography & lettering, graphic design, branding, and beyond.

## WHAT DO WE DO

Our collective encourages the intersection of technology and interdisciplinary studies. We meet monthly (in person) to discuss design and its related topics in a safe and inclusive environment. For those that can‚Äôt join us in person, we also have online spaces where people of all skill levels can collaborate, exchange ideas, learn, receive feedback, maintain accountability, and network.

We approach design from a modern and practical standpoint and hope to work together to improve the overall quality of the craft.
